# Project_stripe
School project where the goal is to create a website on which a user pays to upload a CSV file with ISBNs ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number ). In return the user gets information about the books. 
- The information about the books are retrieved from a REST API. 
- To charge the customer we are going to use Stripe.
